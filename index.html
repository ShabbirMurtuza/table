    <h1>Goa Tourist Attractions</h1>
    <p>Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese
    colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations. Goa is
    also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages
    such as Agonda.</p>
